## Task 1: Generative Models (VAE & GAN)

1. **Download the dataset:**
   - Get the 'cats faces 64x64 (for generative models)' dataset from Kaggle.
   - Create a folder named `data` in the same directory as the code files.
   - Place the downloaded dataset inside the `data` folder.

2. **Configure the dataset path:**
   - Edit the `config.json` file and set the path to the dataset you just downloaded.

3. **Run Task 1 code:**
   - Execute the following files to run the VAE and GAN models:
     - `vae.py`
     - `gan.py`

## Task 2: Arithmetic Sequence-to-Sequence Model

- To run Task 2, simply execute:
  - `A2_Task2.py`

For any issues, check your dataset path and ensure all dependencies are installed.
